# Interval Selection with Predictions
This code was used to generate the experiments of the paper ["Interval Selection with Binary Predictions"](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ckar/isp.pdf).

The datasets used, as well as more datasets under the same format, can be found in [this](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/parallel/workload/) repository with data from scheduling jobs on parallel machines.


The dataset input file and the algorithms to execute are currently hardcoded in main.
